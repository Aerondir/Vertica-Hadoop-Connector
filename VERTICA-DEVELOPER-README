The current directory structure is chosen so that all 
Vertica testing environment specific stuff is in:
1. "." or the hadoop root directory
2. "testing" everything required to run a test in SF env.

"src" directory contains all the source java files.
There is ONE directory per JAR file (as suggested by JAVA standards).
1. hadoop-connector
2. hadoop-example
3. pig-connector
4. squeal

Within each of these directories there can be:
1. src - the actual src code.
2. test - unit tests if any.
3. other supporting stuff as needed.

These directories should not contain any Vertica Testing environment
specific stuff. Hopefully someday this will be in a public repository.
